# AI Governance Readiness Assessment Tool

## Built on the NIST AI Risk Management Framework

This application provides a comprehensive AI governance maturity assessment platform designed specifically for **heavily regulated healthcare payor organizations**. It enables continuous, recursive evaluation of your organization's AI governance capabilities aligned with industry-leading frameworks and regulatory requirements.

## Framework Foundation: NIST AI RMF

The assessment is built on the **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)**, the gold standard for AI governance. The NIST AI RMF provides a structured approach to managing risks associated with AI systems throughout their lifecycle.

### GOVERN Function Focus

This tool specifically implements the **GOVERN** function of the NIST AI RMF, which establishes the foundation for organizational AI risk management through:

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **GOV 1** | Governance Policies & Procedures |
| **GOV 2** | Accountability & Roles |
| **GOV 3** | Human Oversight & Decision-Making |
| **GOV 4** | Culture & Communication |
| **GOV 5** | External Feedback & Stakeholder Engagement |
| **GOV 6** | Third-Party & Vendor Risk |
| **GOV 7** | AI System Lifecycle & Tiered Governance |
| **GOV 8** | Privacy, Security & Compliance |
